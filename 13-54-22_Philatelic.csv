<P>Gerald is one of New Zealand’s foremost postal historians, and for nearly sixty years has been collecting, researching and exhibiting the early postal history of New Zealand. He was invited to sign the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists in 1988, is a recipient of the Fédération Internationale de Philatélie Research Medal, and was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to philately in the 2008 Queen’s Birthday Honours.</P>
<P>The New Zealand Wars collection includes letters written by soldiers serving in British regiments in New Zealand, as well as letters from members of colonial militia and volunteer units. The content and context of the letters provide a wealth of historical, social and military information about this period. The postal markings on the letters and envelopes are also informative, allowing us to track the movement of British troops and the opening up of post offices in their wake.</P>
<P>Many items in the collection are mounted and annotated on archival pages. Gerald wrote the annotations for the purposes of display and storytelling. They reflect his views and the language of the time, and Te Papa has not reviewed them for accuracy. </P>

<P>Dear Mother</P>
<P>Weary and tired i sit down to write these few lines hoping they will find you in good health as they leave me at present thank God for it. Since I write to you last their has a great change taken place in this part of the Country, there is a rebellion amongst the Natives about some land that has been bought of a party of natives which as been proved that they are the proper owners, and there is another party that have no right to the land who have interfered and set British government at defiance and as the land was bought of them by the government we had to take up the cudgels. The disputed land is about 14 miles from Taranaki; one of the interpreters was sent to their pa he found about 70 natives into it and informd them that if they intended to interfere with the Survey of the land they had better be off as the Seamen were about to land and the troops were coming overland and they would all be shot, the natives immediatly decamped we saw nothing of the natives the whole of that day but during the following night the natives returned and erected a strong pa within half a mile of our encampment the erection of the pa must have occupyid about 760 natives as although</P>
<P>[page 2]</P>
<P>Small it was strongly stockaded and entrenched all round. But i had nearly fogoten to describe the March on the 5<SUP>th</SUP> of March at 2 o’Clock morning we marched from Taranaki to the Waitara that is the name of the place where the disputed land is it was a very long and fatiguing March fording rivers and skirmishing through the Bush it is no joke to be marching through this country buckled up and sixty rounds of ammunition i’ll asure you that it made me think of home and how foolish i was to leave it but it is too late to think of that how we arived their safe at about 3 o’clock in the afternoon we took no clean linnin with us we had to go to a dirty stream and wash our shirts and i am not the best hand at washing all the woman from the place are sent to Nelson during the hostilities we were 20 days in Camp at the Waitara and on the 17 of March we had a fight with the Moaries. they got together in a strong fighting pa about 2 miles from camp we took al the force we could muster and as soon as we got near them they hoisted their war flag we stoped there all night they killed two of ours and wounded one they did in the night make of with their killed and wounded we captured their flag and I have sent you apart of it keep it to my memory and if i live to come home it will remind me of old times as a campaigner</P>
<P>[page 3]</P>
<P>Dear Mother i am a very poor hand at describing the life i am leading at present but I will give as true an account as possible. On the 25 of March i got a Taranaki paper and folded it up and dried it and was sitting in my tent to write a few lines to you when an order was given for us to fall in on parade and we were there and then marched of to Taranaki as the natives were about to destroy the town so as we got in town in time we prevented it we marched out the following morning about 5 miles to Omata but they did not show themselves, these natives are a Barbarous people they caught two litle Boys in the Bush they were after Catle the Butchers of Moaries murdered them in a most Brutal manner so on the 28 of March we started of again and met the natives at a place called Waireke they stood fight better their than ever they were known before brave Brittish valour was shown on that day their was upwards two hundred Moaries killed and a great number wounded it was a caution to them there was only 4 killed of ours and 10 wounded their was an officer of the navy dangerously wounded and one man killed. Since that we had a heavy march up the Country better than 30 miles, we destroyed all the natives pas and houses we had to cross about 12 rivers some of them up to the waist and we are placed on watch without</P>
<P>[page 3]</P>
<P>being able to dry our clothes we can eat our hard Buiscut and suffer on we were out eleven days we had several skirmishes with the rascals on our way back but they pop in the thick bush and give us no chance on ariveing to town we found reinforcements had come from Sydney and Hobart over 2 hundred of the 12<SUP>th</SUP> regiment and 400 of the 40<SUP>th</SUP> and two man of wars and it is reported here that their will be some coming from home then we can scour the whole country there is the winter setting in that is worse for us. that is all I can tell you at present, Dear Mother i am not so much afraid of the Mauriey Ball or tomahawk as i am of some disease or other arising from colds i have hitherto escaped bath, and trust through the Blessing of god i shall to the end, i have given up the lance stripe as their was to much running about atached to it and i should never Benifet by it. Dear Mother since i have entered the Brittish Service nothing has afforded mee more pleasure than to hear from you, nothing would give mee more greif than to hear of anything happening to you, but i will bear my fortune without rejoining at the will of god i have one hope left it is the fondest wish of my heart it is that my mother may be spared until i see her once more likewise my Dear Sisters Maryan and Martha James and all the rest.

<P>My Dear Sister</P>
<P>I received your kind and welcome letter yesterday and was glad to hear that you was in good health as these few lines leave mee at present thank God for it, Dear Martha you must be surprised at my mind being so changeable you must consider the critical position i am I, and as been so long at one moment this Country is like a paradise at another moment al apears Black and Miserable to me, bereft of all that is dear to me not a friend nor a relation in the country for as a soldier you can not form any acquaintance with civilians and i assure you my comrades in a Barrack room their company is not the best for the most of them think of nothing but cursing and drinking, and Dear Sister i have not forgot the advice i got at home and since i left it i would like to get into better society </P>
<P>[page 2]</P>
<P>Dear Martha you must excuse my wandering mind for existing circumstances as made it so for when i spoke of stoping out here i was reasoning with myself upon my future course for it is upermost in my mind and i came to the conclusion that it would be best for me to stop out here it was no connection that i had formed as you have already spoken of, no if it was i should not try to disguis it from you for i am not in a position to form any such intimacy, no but things as assumed a far differend aspect since then, for i thought as others thought when the peace was made in Taranaki that al was over but there is a general war threatened al through the land. there is every preparation for it on both sides but i hope it wil be averted if not it wil be the cause of detaining our regiment out here longer and until everything is properly setled their wil be no discharges given at all</P>
<P>[page 3]</P>
<P>So Dear Sister i must decline giving any decided opinion of My Future Steps for until I have the chance of obtaining my liberty which I see not the slightest chance at present it is scarcely worth while but i must live in hopes if i die in despair i bear it with fortitude al the ups and downs of this life a life or profession i selected when I did not know how happy i could have been at home with My Dear Mother and Sister and al that was dear to mee but its useless to talk of that now, this is Sunday and oh what a contrast to the one i have spent at home where i used to join in singing hymns with My Father and Sister on the domestic hearth oh i look on them as happy days as that i thought as much of them then as i do now it would have saved many a aching heart and many a falling tear and hardship and misery and danger and suspense enough of that it goes to</P>
<P>spear my heart</P>
<P>[page 4]</P>
<P>i hope some one will profit by my misfortune and avoid the step that I took.<BR>Dear Mary anne i would like to have a few words with you but i have already said as much as i feel able, but i feel thankful to you for reminding mee that it is to the almighty that all praise is due for preserving mee through all the dangers i have been exposed for after we once escape a danger and think we are safe we almost seem to forget him yes on the Field of Battle when deadly messengers have been whizzing about have i looked up to him <S>to him</S> for that and which none other could bestow oh that we were all prepared the time when we will be called upon<BR>i have nothing more to say at present but give my dearest love to My Mother</P>

<P>Dear Mother.</P>
<P>I write these few lines to you hoping they will find you in good health as they leave mee at present thank God for it. Since i wrote to you last we have formed our Head quarters at the Front about 160 miles from Auckland it is a beautiful Setlement their has been several skirmishes since you heard from mee last but none of any importance the natives have gone father in the country</P>
<P>[page 2]</P>
<P>and it doubful wether their will be another attack this Summer or not as there is a great dificulty experienced in transporting rations up to us the river is to low for the Steamers to come up and all the rations as to come up on pack horses we are about 3 miles from a fine settlement called Rangiahia. the troops will have to go to winter quarters shortly as nothing can be done here in winter but hold our positions the General has made another move in another Direction where the Natives have another position and if they make a stand we are to reinforce him i can give no more particulars at present but i hope this affair will soon End as no one can judge what it is except those that have experienced it. <BR>Dear Mother, will you be kind enough to tell Maryann that i should like to hear from her as it a long time since i heard from her or James</P>
